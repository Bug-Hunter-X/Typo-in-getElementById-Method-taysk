# Uncommon HTML Error: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur in HTML/JavaScript code.  The error involves a simple typo in the `getElementById` method, resulting in unexpected behavior. 

## The Bug
The `bug.html` file contains a typo in the JavaScript code; the method name has an 'x' at the end. This will cause the script to fail silently, without throwing any errors in the browser console, making it harder to debug.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file corrects the typo, fixing the issue and correctly adding the dynamic content to the div element.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the dynamic content is not added.
4. Open `bugSolution.html`. 
5. Observe that the dynamic content is added successfully.
